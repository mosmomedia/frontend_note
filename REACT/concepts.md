## Fundamentals of React

**Components**: Components are the fundamental building elements of each React application, and most applications include a few components. A part is a user interface element. React divides the user interfaces into distinct, reusable components that might be taken care of independently.

It utilizes two sorts of components :

· _Functional Components_: These components are otherwise called stateless components since they have no state of their own. As props, they might extricate data from different components (properties).

· _Class Components_: These components have a distinct render function for returning JSX to the screen and may keep and control their state. Since they can have a state, they are in some cases named stateful components.

**State**: The state object is a built-in React object that stores information or data about the part. A part’s state can change over the long run, and when it works out, the part should be re-rendered. The part’s state might change as a result of user activity or framework-generated occasions, and these progressions affect the way of behaving of the part.

**Properties (Props)**: Properties are abbreviated as props. It’s a built-in React object that saves the worth of a label’s attributes and functions in basically the same manner as HTML attributes. It permits you to send data starting with one part and then onto the next similarly as arguments are passed in a function.
