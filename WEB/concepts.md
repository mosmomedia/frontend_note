## Express, body parser

Express, as you know, is a web framework that weâ€™ll be using for building the REST APIs, and body-parser is a module that parses the request (of various content types) and creates a req.body object that we can access in our routes.

## Express

Express is one of the most popular web frameworks for node.js. It is built on top of node.js http module, and adds support for routing, middleware, view system etc. It is very simple and minimal, unlike other frameworks that try do way to much, thereby reducing the flexibility for developers to have their own design choices.

## Mongoose

Mongoose is an ODM (Object Document Mapping) tool for Node.js and MongoDB. It helps you convert the objects in your code to documents in the database and vice versa.

## Middleware

A middleware is a function that has access to the request and response objects. It can execute any code, transform the request object, or return a response.
