Cascading: this concept is about the order of CSS rules, and when two rules apply that have equal specificity the one that comes last in the CSS is the one that will be used.

Inheritance: there are some CSS properties that when set on parentsâ€™ elements are passed to their children, and some are not. This can be qui confusing for a beginner. For example, properties such as colour and font-family are inherited by children.

Specificity: When applying multiple rules to an element, rules that cause a conflict are applied by specificity. Each selector has its own specificity ranking:

ID
Class and Pseudo Classes
Element selectors

To gain a robust knowledge of CSS is it important to learn how these three concepts interact with each other to control which rules are applied to what element.
